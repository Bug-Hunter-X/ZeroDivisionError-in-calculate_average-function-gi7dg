This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates a common error handling issue. The function `calculate_average` calculates the average of a list of numbers. However, it fails when provided with an empty list, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The solution demonstrates how to handle this edge case using proper error handling techniques. The files included are:

- `bug.py`: Contains the function with the error.
- `bugSolution.py`: Provides a corrected version with improved error handling.
